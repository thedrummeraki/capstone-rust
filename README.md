### Background

This is my capstone project, written in Rust, which serves as a conclusion an condensed Rust course I have been part of.

> Note: This project may stay public until shortly after the course ends.

### Planning

The time restrictions for this project tight, so planning will be rigourous and be done with Github's Project's features. You can check a list of tasks in the list of [Issues](https://github.com/thedrummeraki/capstone-rust/issues) (deliverables, when applicable, will be tied to each task). 

Check out the overall progress in the project: [Toward the final sprint](https://github.com/users/thedrummeraki/projects/1).

### Usage

Instructions on how to run this project will be coming soon.

#### Requirements

TBD
